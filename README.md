Arduino Sound Sensor and LED Project

Description

  This project uses an Arduino Uno R3 board to read sound levels from a sound sensor and control an LED based on the detected sound level. The analog output (AO) from the sound sensor is read to determine the sound   intensity. If the sound level exceeds a predefined threshold, the LED will turn on. Additionally, the sound level readings are sent to the serial monitor, which can be visualized using the serial plotter in the   Arduino IDE.

Components
  1. Arduino Uno R3 board
  2. Sound sensor with pins labeled DO, +, G, and AO
  3. LED
  4. 220-ohm resistor
  5. Breadboard and connecting wires
